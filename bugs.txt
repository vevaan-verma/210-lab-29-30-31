1. Small formatting issue with the final output: there are no commas placed between artist names, genres, and weather conditions, which could be confusing for the user.
2. The program wait time after each simulation round was too long, which could be an annoyance to the user.
3. Weather conditions don't output at the end.
4. Program output is a little cluttered.
5. Choices aren't randomized each time, which ruins the simulation.
6. File isn't being closed, which could cause memory leaks.
7. File validation isn't checked when it is open, so an error could be caused if the file doesn't exist.
8. Weather conditions are added to the wrong list.
9. Fix comma removal issue in final output (not a major bug as the extra character was a space, so it wouldn't be noticed anyways).
10. Error code isn't returned when file error occurs.
11. Import for the 1 second wait constant isn't included.
