Testing simulateFestivalAtmosphere():
- I would use unit testing to verify that this function works correctly by adding a single element to the map with known data. Then, I would call this function on the map and then output the data after the function is called to verify that the data was actually modified randomly as it should be.
- One important thing to do this is to seed the random number generator to confirm that the data is being randomly generated.

Driver Program:
/* FUNCTION PROTOTYPES */
void simulateFestivalAtmosphere(map<string, array<list<string>, 3>>& festivalData, string stageName, int hour);

int main() {

	srand(time(0)); // seed the random number generator so we get different results each time to ensure randomization

	map<string, array<list<string>, 3>> festivalData;

	array<list<string>, 3> mainStageData;
	mainStageData[0].push_back("R&B"); // add sample genre
	mainStageData[1].push_back("The Weeknd"); // add sample artist
	mainStageData[2].push_back("Sunny"); // add sample weather

	festivalData["Main Stage"] = mainStageData; // insert the sample data into the map

	simulateFestivalAtmosphere(festivalData, "Main Stage", 1); // call the function to test it and pass hour 1 because this is just a unit test

	// output the updated data to console to verify that the function actually changed the data of the stage
	cout << "Main Stage" << endl;
	cout << festivalData.at("Main Stage")[0].front() << endl;
	cout << festivalData.at("Main Stage")[1].front() << endl;
	cout << festivalData.at("Main Stage")[2].front() << endl;
	
	return 0;

}

// simulateFestivalAtmosphere() will take in the map and the current hour of the festival and randomly choose between the three events: artist changes, song genre changes, and weather effects
// arguments: map<string, array<list<string>, 3>>& festivalData - the map that contains the data of each stage at the festival, int hour - the current hour of the festival
// returns: none
void simulateFestivalAtmosphere(map<string, array<list<string>, 3>>& festivalData, string stageName, int hour) {

	// bug found through unit testing: if the stage name is not found in the map, the program will crash

	// the function will take in the map and the current hour of the festival
	// randomly choose between the three events: artist changes, song genre changes, and weather effects
	int event = rand() % 3;

	if (event == 0) { // artist changes

		festivalData[stageName][0].clear(); // clear the list of genres

		// stage can have up to 3 genres of music being played at the same time
		int genreCount = rand() % 3 + 1; // randomly select the number of genres that will be played on that stage

		for (int i = 0; i < genreCount; i++) { // for each genre that will be played on that stage

			string newGenre = GENRES[rand() % GENRES.size()]; // randomly select a new genre to replace the current genre(s) on that stage
			festivalData[stageName][0].push_back(newGenre); // add the new genre to the list

		}

		cout << "Hour " << hour << ": Song genre changes at " << stageName << endl; // output the event change

	} else if (event == 1) { // song genre changes

		// stage can have up to 3 artists performing at the same time
		int artistCount = rand() % 3 + 1; // randomly select the number of artists that will perform on that stage
		festivalData[stageName][1].clear(); // clear the list of artists

		for (int i = 0; i < artistCount; i++) { // for each artist that will perform on that stage

			string newArtist = ARTISTS[rand() % ARTISTS.size()]; // randomly select an artist to replace the current artist(s) on that stage
			festivalData[stageName][1].push_back(newArtist); // add the new artist to the list

		}

		cout << "Hour " << hour << ": Artists on stage change at " << stageName << endl; // output the event change

	} else if (event == 2) { // weather effect changes

		festivalData[stageName][2].clear(); // clear the list of weather

		// stage can have up to 3 weather conditions at the same time (due to the existence of partly cloudy, etc.)
		int weatherCount = rand() % 3 + 1; // randomly select the number of weather conditions that will affect that stage

		for (int i = 0; i < weatherCount; i++) { // for each weather condition that will affect that stage

			string newWeather = WEATHER[rand() % WEATHER.size()]; // randomly select a new weather condition to replace the current weather on that stage
			festivalData[stageName][2].push_back(newWeather); // add the new weather to the list

		}

		cout << "Hour " << hour << ": Weather effect changes at " << stageName << endl; // output the event change

	}
}

Testing outputFestivalInfo():
- I would use unit testing to verify that this function works correctly by creating a map and adding one element with known data to it. Then I would pass that element into the function and verify that the correct information is outputted.

Driver Program:
/* FUNCTION PROTOTYPES */
void outputFestivalInfo(map<string, array<list<string>, 3>>& festivalData);

int main() {

	map<string, array<list<string>, 3>> festivalData;

	array<list<string>, 3> mainStageData;
	mainStageData[0].push_back("R&B"); // add sample genre
	mainStageData[1].push_back("The Weeknd"); // add sample artist
	mainStageData[2].push_back("Sunny"); // add sample weather

	festivalData["Main Stage"] = mainStageData; // insert the sample data into the map

	outputFestivalInfo(festivalData); // call the function to test it

	// this unit test would ensure that the correct contents (the contents added above) are outputted to the console

	return 0;

}

// outputFestivalInfo() will take in the map and output the current atmosphere of the festival
// arguments: map<string, array<list<string>, 3>>& festivalData - the map that contains the data of each stage at the festival
// returns: none
void outputFestivalInfo(map<string, array<list<string>, 3>>& festivalData) {

	// output the current atmosphere of the festival using the following format:
	/*
	Stage: <stage name>
		Artist(s): <artist name>
		Genre(s): <genre name>
		Weather: <weather condition>
	*/

	// this whole section below outputs the current atmosphere of the festival using the format above
	for (auto stage : festivalData) {

		cout << "Stage: " << stage.first << endl;
		cout << "\tArtist(s): ";

		for (auto artist : stage.second[1])
			cout << artist << " ";

		cout << endl << "\tGenre(s): ";

		for (auto genre : stage.second[0])
			cout << genre << " ";

		cout << endl << "\tWeather: ";

		for (auto weather : stage.second[2])
			cout << weather << " ";

		cout << endl;

	}

	cout << endl; // output a blank line for formatting purposes

}
